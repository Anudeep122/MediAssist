The lungs appear hyperinflated.  A small pleural effusion is suspected on the right side, but not necessarily changed.   Small nodular densities at the lung apices are probably consistent with minor scarring but nodules could be considered; a subsequent CT on the same day shows no discrete nodules however.  A mild interstitial process involving the lung bases persists.  Interstitial opacities have increased at the left lung base, although this may be due to decreased low lung volumes, but slight increase in chronic congestion could be considered.  The bones appear demineralized.  Mild degenerative changes are present along the lower thoracic spine and there are similar lower vertebral compression deformities. Impression: Similar to perhaps slightly increased peripheral interstitial opacities in the lower lungs, which may be exaggerated by decreased lung volumes but superimposed congestion or worsening interstitial lung disease could be considered.

A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, appears unchanged.  The heart is again mild-to-moderately enlarged.  A diffuse mild interstitial abnormality is suggestive of mild vascular congestion, but more focal opacities in the upper lungs have improved.  A hazy appearance of the left lung base suggests a persistent pleural effusion as was seen on the prior radiographs and CT, which may also explain elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  The effusion and associated opacity have increased. Impression: Increasing left basilar opacification with a suspected pleural effusion or opacity probably compatible with associated atelectasis; although an infectious process is difficult to exclude, focal upper lung opacities have mostly resolved.

Additionally, atelectasis within both lung bases appears worse in the interval.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are without relevant changed.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is demonstrated.  Moderate degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine. Impression: Lower lung volumes result in worsening bibasilar atelectasis and obscure assessment of the lung parenchyma, and in particular, the region of the potential pulmonary nodule seen on the previous radiograph.
