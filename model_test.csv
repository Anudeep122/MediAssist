model_dataset_images_2_test\f544deed-35c4450e-f5bc7205-738b6fe4-d61a0f20.jpg,"Findings:  Impression: 1.  Interval placement of a left subclavian central line which has its tip in the proximal superior vena cava, likely along the lateral wall.  The heart remains enlarged status post median sternotomy for CABG.  Although this may reflect cardiomegaly, a pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded.  There is mild interstitial edema.  There is likely a small, left greater than right layering effusions.  The left costophrenic angle is not entirely included on the study.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is also a rounded opacity in the aortopulmonary window, which may simply reflect a prominent pulmonary artery as this appears to be present on only some of the previous studies and therefore a vascular etiology would be more likely than lymphadenopathy."

There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Mild prominence of the central airways could reflect a mild bronchitis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen. Impression: Possible bronchitis."

Vague linear opacity on the frontal view at the left lung base is most likely atelectasis as there is no correlate view on the lateral view.  No definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm. Impression: Left lung base atelectasis.  No signs of pneumonia.

Tiny nodular foci projecting over the right mid lung over the right sixth and seventh posterior ribs likely represent calcified granulomas. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen. Impression: No acute intrathoracic process."
model_dataset_images_2_test\aa70345b-938ccd19-679fcbe5-53ab3be4-e1823f62.jpg,Findings:  Impression: Lungs are clear. Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces.  Mild thoracic scoliosis noted.  No compression fracture.
model_dataset_images_2_test\159cd2dc-37638332-de42e3ab-56483c60-4f4887e2.jpg,"Findings: Single portable view of the chest.  Lung apices are obscured due to patient positioning.  Where seen, the lungs are clear.  Previously seen left basilar opacity has essentially resolved and the costophrenic angle is now sharp.  Right chest wall dual lead pacing device is again seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected. Impression: No acute cardiopulmonary process."
model_dataset_images_2_test\0622c726-d449ce14-8c2864b7-a2982ef5-53727a81.jpg,"Findings: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.  The monitoring and support devices are constant.  There is unchanged appearance of the low lung volumes and the moderate retrocardiac atelectasis as well as the mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  No larger pleural effusions.  No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. Impression:"
model_dataset_images_2_test\7fce7588-1f0a78c9-36b6dee9-7bbebe58-57a2fed2.jpg,Findings: PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  The lungs are clear.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal. Impression: Normal radiograph of the chest.
model_dataset_images_2_test\0f5d06eb-b3d360fe-5675c84a-7c3206a0-8b43d664.jpg,"Findings: The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is slight interstitial abnormality with peribronchial cuffing that is more prominent in the right lung than the left but vague.  Small osteophytes are noted along the thoracic spine. Impression: Questionable interstitial abnormality primarily on the left; differential considerations include lower airway inflammation or perhaps slight vascular congestion, but there is no frank congestive heart failure or focal consolidation."
model_dataset_images_2_test\03e56723-8ac917d4-7530ab5e-0765a832-70fcb9e9.jpg,"Findings: Multifocal areas of consolidation involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left with associated foci of cavitation appears similar to the recent chest radiograph except for the left retrocardiac region, which shows some interval improved aeration.  Findings are consistent with history of MRSA pneumonia.  Small right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size in the interval.  There is no visible pneumothorax. Impression:"
model_dataset_images_2_test\4a8f72c8-4a85e8ea-eb0ac36e-a3eb2de8-a15c8514.jpg,Findings: A dual lead left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged in position with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Reticulonodular opacities and prominent interstitial markings most pronounced in the right lung base may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema although superimposed infection is not excluded.  Decreased trace pleural effusions are noted. No pneumothorax seen.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Several clips are noted within the upper abdomen. Marked degenerative changes of the right shoulder are again seen. Impression: 1.  Patchy opacity in the right lung base may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema although superimposed infection is not excluded.    2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and decreased bilateral trace pleural effusion.   3.  Stable cardiomegaly.
