model_dataset_images_2_train\1b0d7ce7-96b60ea0-50a13203-89ecc550-c2b836b2.jpg,Findings:  Impression: Right port a cath tip is in thecavoatrial junction. Cardiac size is top normal.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  .  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
model_dataset_images_2_train\1db1771a-682a6ec3-609bef0c-49bf5a99-ab85618a.jpg,"Findings: PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen. Impression: No acute intrathoracic process."
model_dataset_images_2_train\10c1b420-0415d0e9-88c562e1-b78b9f23-180227ac.jpg,"Findings: The lungs are well expanded and clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Impression: No acute cardiopulmonary process."
model_dataset_images_2_train\f80af987-a2838565-e7b5beae-b0fb5cfb-a34ea189.jpg,"Findings: As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pleural effusion has minimally decreased.  Otherwise, the radiograph is completely unchanged, including the position of the monitoring and support devices.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. Impression:"
model_dataset_images_2_train\68a18d41-c7fa0277-9f74eae8-92c4a5e2-97b5513c.jpg,Findings:  Impression: Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are clear.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
model_dataset_images_2_train\21c4a8d2-9e73bae8-04e3bc19-c5d62a77-60e0d4d0.jpg,"Findings:  Impression: In comparison with the previous study, there has been complete clearing of the right lower lobe pneumonia. No abnormality is seen at this time."
model_dataset_images_2_train\79f670b8-40eb55f1-e0538f76-2700ddd6-f9fde8d7.jpg,"Findings: Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate no current evidence of pneumonia.  The heart, lungs, mediastinum, hila, and pleural surfaces are normal. Impression: Normal chest radiograph."
model_dataset_images_2_train\4732d966-ab192301-9b85ea9c-4843d72d-42559c11.jpg,"Findings:  Impression: As compared to the previous image, no relevant change is seen. The fibrotic changes at both lung bases are constant in appearance. The reflect either passed infection or a mild form of interstitial lung disease. No new or recent parenchymal changes are noted. Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of pleural effusions on the lateral image."
model_dataset_images_2_train\3d640f95-fa001191-f819fe73-5124024d-19e2865a.jpg,"Findings: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing opacities at the lung bases are seen in unchanged manner.  On the left, the opacity appears to be caused by an area of fibrosis.  On the right, the opacity is overlaying the rib crossing and could be projectional.  Neither the right nor the left opacity suggest acute pneumonia.  Otherwise, normal lung parenchyma.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions. Impression:"
model_dataset_images_2_train\8008fcb6-4e512213-e4df478c-6bd9d313-a67ee018.jpg,"Findings: Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrates hyperexpanded, clear lungs.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation. Impression: No acute cardiopulmonary process."
model_dataset_images_2_train\1cfe93a8-d6896172-007f79e4-e9972a17-8c7be556.jpg,"Findings: The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette which is unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Aortic knob calcifications are again seen.  There is persistent upper zone vascular redistribution, compatible with chronic congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema.  Linear opacity within the right lung base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Impression: Chornic mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema."
